### scripts
Each python script is named after the figure it produces in the paper, followed by a brief description of the computation performed.
Figure 5 and 6, representing the fit of two blazars multi-wavelength SEDs, can be produced either using sherpa or gammapy fitting routines.
`utils.py` contains some utility function for timing and reproduction of the reference results. 

### yaml environment
The `agnpy_paper.yml` file can be used to set-up a `conda` environment containing the same dependencies used in the paper.
It is suggested to create a new environment via
```shell
conda env create -f agnpy_paper.yml
```
and activate it 
```shell
source activate agnpy_paper
```
after activating the environment, each script can be executed via the command line with
```shell
python figure_2_synchrotron_example.py
```

## Docker container
To conserve the exact computational environment of the paper we created a Docker container.    
The container is [available on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cosimonigro/agnpy_paper).

### build the container yourself
After you have installed docker, to build the container using the `Dockerfile` in this repository type:
```
docker build -t agnpy_paper .
```

### run the container
To run the container:
```
docker run -it --rm agnpy_paper
```
the container shell will open with the `agnpy_paper` conda environment activated and within the `agnpy_paper` repository: users can directly run any of the scripts.

The scripts do not display any of the plots, but save them in a `figures` directory that can be generated by any of the scripts.
The easiest solution to visualise the figures produced by the scripts is to create a local `figures` repository and mount it in the container:
```
mdkir figures
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD/figures:/root/agnpy_paper/figures agnpy_paper
```
and then visualise the figures from the local filesysytem.
